    "Thankfully, in this case, the data has been formatted incredibly well for us already. As you determine the kinds of questions you want to explore, you may find that this dataset alone isn't enough and you'll need to augment the data with other demographic, financial, or other data. Google is your friend when searching for new datasets, but here are a few places you can explore as starting points:\n",

    "We will provide you with one tip however! The CSV file from FiveThirtyEight's Github repo contains poorly formatted characters and the Python interpreter will actually throw an error if you try to use read_csv to read into a DataFrame object. You will have to add a flag that will allow Pandas to import the dataset safely, as we'll show you below. To read more about the different character encodings, read this phenomenal post by programmer Joel Spolsky: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"

    "California, Texas, and Florida have the most killings but have a much higher population. What are some ways you can calibrate for the difference in population?\n",

    "Phase 4 - Data Presentation\n",
    "A huge aspect of data science is communicating the results of your analysis to others. In many companies, data scientists work alongside Marketing and Product Management teams and have to present results to team members who aren't well versed with data science. Communicating your results could be involve a Powerpoint presentation, a one-page research report, or a data dive so team members can ask you follow up questions that you can quickly answer. For personal projects, we highly recommend publishing the iPython Notebook file (.ipynb) to your Github and building a portfolio website to demonstrate your work.\n",
